# SMA3D - Damping monitoring system of a structure through inertial counterweight
[[PT-Br]](README.br.md)

SMA3D is a simulator of the damping of a structure using a pendulum as an inertial counterweight.

With the simulator it is possible to calculate the ideal size of the pendulum, the correction factor and the frequency of the structure with the counterweight.

### Prerequisites

All the simulation was developed using Unity 3D, to continue the development it is necessary to download.
